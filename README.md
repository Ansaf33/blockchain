# blockchain
**NITC on blocks** is a custom blockchain implementation project aimed at understanding blockchains. The project is planned in six stages and is programming language independent. The end result is a custom blockchain with native cryptocurrency with miners and simulated block sealing by miners with transactions stored in Merkle Tree.
The blockchain is Proof of Work based with simulated miner block sealing and block reward system.

## Some Prerequisites

### Merkle Tree

Merkle tree also known as hash tree is a data structure used for data verification and synchronization. 
It is a tree data structure where each non-leaf node is a hash of it’s child nodes. All the leaf nodes are at the same depth and are as far left as possible. 
It maintains data integrity and uses hash functions for this purpose. 


### Block

 a block is a fundamental unit that stores a collection of data. Each block contains a set of transactions or records and is linked to the previous block, forming a chain—hence the term "blockchain".

### SHA3-256

SHA3-256 is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 256-bit (32-byte) hash value. It is part of the SHA-3 family, which was standardized by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) in 2015 as an alternative to SHA-2.
